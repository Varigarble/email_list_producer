**email_list_producer.py:** Enter a first, middle, and last name and a domain name in email_list_producer.py to produce 
a list of commonly used combinations of names, initials, and periods at that domain name. See "FirstMiddleLast 
potential emails.txt" for a sample output.

**fake_binary_counter.py:** I'm including it in this project because it elucidates the core logic of adding 
permutations to a list without the added complexity of string slicing, permuting periods, and checking other string
conditions.

After making a fake binary counter, I felt I had to work out real binary-decimal conversion code. 
**real_binary_counter.py** and **binary_to_decimal.py** are in this project just for fun. It's been done before. They
 don't need their own repository.
